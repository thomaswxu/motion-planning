# motion-planning
This repository holds code for various motion and path planning explorations, with a focus on robot arms.

## Robot Arm Motion Planning

Most robot arms have 6 degrees of freedom (DOF). This makes path and motion planning more difficult to visualize than for 2D or 3D cases, but the principles and applicable algorithms are the same.

In this repository, A* and the Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM) method along with some of their variants are used.

The code in this repository assumes a generic 6 DOF robot arm (arm model determines dimensions, joint angle limits, etc. during planning).
